# IGW-Compressibility
An analysis of internal gravity wave (IGW) characteristics to assess the significance of compressibility in simulating IGWs. This repository consists of raw simulation data for flow over a bell-shaped hill simulated with SOWFA-6 and WRF. Moreover, comparisons of wave characteristics are made with linear theory solutions from LBoW.
